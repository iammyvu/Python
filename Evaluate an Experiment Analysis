Now it's time to flex your critical evaluation skills. Read the following descriptions of an experiment and its analysis, identify the flaws in each, and describe what you would do to correct them.

1) The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.
- FLAWS: Are the droids from different categories? Do they have the same or similar builts? Is one group more techincally advanced than the other?
- CORRECTION: Look more into the droids and if they have different models/builts, make sure they are distributed equally between the two groups. 

2) In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.
- FLAWS: From each planet, how many did Jar Jar Binks talk to vs. how many did Mace Windu talk to? If Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu talked to the same group (or the whole population), who got to talk first? Last? What time of the day during which their speaks happened?
- CORRECTION: From each planet, sample two equal groups of people of all ages, genders, occupations, physical conditions, etc. and have each group listen to Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu at the same time. 

3) A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.
- FLAWS: Simpson's Paradox, job types ain't equally distributed across job sites.
- CORRECTION: Sampling reports from sites where both job types take place. 

4) When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.
- FLAWS: Sampling bias. The people who voluntarily 'opt in' are more likely to already set their minds in increasing activity levels. Moreoever, the fact that they know they are being tracked possibly make them more conscious in pumping up their fitness levels.
- CORRECTION: Automatic data collection without prior notification, so that the whole population's activity level is measured with out external influences.

5) To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.
- FLAWS: Clustered splitting method.
- CORRECTION: Make sure all 3 versions are randomly mixed and distributed to students regardless of when they show up for the exam.
