In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.

-- THE PROBLEM:
Jedi has difficulty with public relations and wants to build better connections with other planets. 

-- THE POTENTIAL SOLUTION: 
The most popular convoy, either Jar Jar Binks or Mace Windu, will be given the role of a representative, helping Jedi making friends with other planets.

-- THE METHOD OF TESTING THE SOLUTION:
From each of 4 friendly and 4 unfriendly planets:
1) Select two equal groups of citizens, from different ages, social statuses, genders, fitness 
2) Subject each group to two different treatments, making sure other factors are the same while the treatments occur.

Treatment 1 (Group A)- listen to Jar Jar Binks
Treatment 1 (Group B)- listen to Mace Windu
Treatment 2 (Group A)- listen to Mace Windu
Treatment 2 (Group B)- listen to Jar Jar Binks

3) After each group undergoes both treatment, analyze which convoy receive the most favorable response by comparing their average approval scores.
