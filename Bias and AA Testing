• You're testing advertising e-mails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
Bias: Seasonality
Reasons: People are less likely to buy a bathing suit during cold months; therefore, their responses are strongly influenced by seasonality and not due to email advertising versions.

• You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
Bias: Sampling 
Reasons: People who come to the clinic are either self- or clinically diagnosed with anxiety, and are actively seeking treatment. 

• You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
Bias: Contextual/Observer
Reasons: 'The first week' might have coincided with a major holiday/special season, which promoted people's interest, not neccessarily because they saw the new billboard ad. On the other hand, if it really was because people saw the new billboard ad; just one week would be too short to determine the new ad's effectiveness. People's interest might peak at the beginning, but dip soon afterwards, resulting in website visit decreases significantly as time passes by. Give it more time before determining the new billboard's effectiveness. 

• You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
Bias: Observer
Reasons: Time can play a big factor in guaging people's interest. Maybe people take a while to get used to the new website but eventually warm up to it? Instead of one week, keep collecting data for another week or more.
