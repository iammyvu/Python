• You're testing advertising e-mails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
Bias: Seasonality
Reasons: People are less likely to buy a bathing suit during cold months; therefore, their responses are strongly influenced by seasonality and not due to email advertising versions.

• You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
Bias: Sampling 
Reasons: People who come to the clinic are either self- or clinically diagnosed with anxiety, and are actively seeking treatment. 

• You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
Bias: Contextual
Reasons: 'The first week' might have coincided with a major holiday/special season, which promoted people's interest, not neccessarily because they saw the new billboard campaign.

• You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
Bias: Observer
Reasons: A wrong method for measuring people's interests. Maybe instead of numbers of visits, measure the numbers of new visitors signing up instead.
